  dni if you joke about israel , ICE , the epstein files , etc. these aren't things that should be joked about - real, innocent victims are being harmed daily. joking about attrocities leads to desensitization. whether on purpose or not, if you poke fun at all the horrid things happening, you assist in normalizing them.
